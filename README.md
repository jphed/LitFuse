# How to properly set up a GitHub repository **Not dying in the process** (maybe)

## Step 1 - Who's this random?
> Introduce yourself to Git and say "Hi" loser, don't be rude ðŸ””ðŸ””ðŸ””<br><br>
> `git config --global user.name "Name Last_Name`<br>
> `git config --global user.email random@gmail.com`<br><br>
> First step ain't necessary at all but at least Git is gonna know who are you (you're not special)


## Step 2 - Make ssh keys and add them to GitHub
> You're first gonna set up your ssh key<br><br>
> `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com`<br>
